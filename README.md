      **Tailwind CSS Notes:**
    >
    > This project uses **Tailwind CSS 4.x (pure ESM)** with PostCSS integration.
    > - Tailwind scaffolding has been pre-wired with:
    > - `tailwind.config.js`
    > - `postcss.config.js`
    > - `@tailwindcss/postcss` adapter
    >
    > ‚úÖ No additional Tailwind initialization steps are required.
    >
    > _**Note:** If you attempt to run `npx tailwindcss init` and receive ESM/npx errors, this is due to Tailwind 4.x + npm 11 ESM incompatibility. This repo is already fully configured for you._

3. **Environment Setup**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 # Replace with your backend API server's URL
